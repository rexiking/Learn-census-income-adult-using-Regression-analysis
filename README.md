we are using diffrent machine learning sklearn model to identify which one model could be effective to analysis the data , the close to 100% the better one can be perform at that module and so one of them is using adaboost model to identify the future of this data that would be .

84.06%. It had a recall score of 93.08%, which means it correctly identified 93.08% of the positive cases. The specificity score was 54.58%, indicating that it correctly identified 54.58% of the negative cases. The precision score was 87.01%, meaning that of all the predicted positive cases, 87.01% were actually positive.
The Decision Tree model had an accuracy score of 79.74%. It had a recall score of 86.00% and a specificity score of 59.29%. The precision score was 87.35%.
The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model had an accuracy score of 80.78%. It had a recall score of 90.38% and a specificity score of 49.44%. The precision score was 85.38%.
The Support Vector Machine (SVM) model had an accuracy score of 83.79%. It had a recall score of 93.66% and a specificity score of 51.51%. The precision score was 86.32%.
The Random Forest model had an accuracy score of 83.28%. It had a recall score of 91.77% and a specificity score of 55.53%. The precision score was 87.08%.
The Adaboost model had an accuracy score of 84.59%. It had a recall score of 93.39% and a specificity score of 55.85%. The precision score was 87.36%.
The Bagging model had an accuracy score of 82.43%. It had a recall score of 88.97% and a specificity score of 61.09%. The precision score was 88.19%.
The Extra Trees model had an accuracy score of 81.65%. It had a recall score of 89.48% and a specificity score of 56.06%. The precision score was 86.94%.
The Naive model had the lowest accuracy score of 37.99%. It had a recall score of 20.09% and a specificity score of 96.45%. The precision score was 94.87%.
Based on these results, the Logistic Regression model is recommended as it had the highest accuracy score and performed well in terms of recall, specificity, and precision.
